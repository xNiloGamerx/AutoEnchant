# General Features

# How to use
It is relatively simple:
1. Throw an enchanted book with an enchantment of your choice on a normal enchantment table to turn it into an AutoEnchanter
2. Right-click on the enchanter with the item you want to enchant
3. Wait until the item is enchanted with the enchantment you throw on the table
4. Your item gets dropped, be careful to don't loose it!

Every time you enchant it costs 5xp levels
